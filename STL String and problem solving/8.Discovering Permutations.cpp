/*In this problem you have to find the permutations using the first N English capital letters. Since there can be many permutations,
you have to print the first K.

Input
Input starts with an integer T (≤ 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case contains two integers N, K (1 ≤ N ≤ 26, 1 ≤ K ≤ 30).

Output
For each case, print the case number in a line. Then print the first K permutations that contain the first N English capital letters in
alphabetical order. If there are less than K permutations then print all of them.
